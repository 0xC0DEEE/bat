## Main Features

- Expressive and intuitive syntax
- Built-in JSON support
- Forms and file uploads
- HTTPS, proxies, and authentication
- Arbitrary request data
- Custom headers

## Installation

	go get -u github.com/astaxie/bat
	
make sure the `$GOPATH/bin` is added into `$PATH`

## Usage

Hello World:

	$ bat beego.me

Synopsis:

	bat [flags] [METHOD] URL [ITEM [ITEM]]
	
See also `bat --help`.	

### Examples

Custom [HTTP method](#HTTP Method), [HTTP headers](HTTP Headers) and [JSON](#JSON) data:

	$ bat PUT example.org X-API-Token:123 name=John

Submitting forms:

	$ bat -form=true POST example.org hello=World
	
See the request that is being sent using one of the output options:

	$ bat -v example.org

Use Github API to post a comment on an issue with authentication:

	$ bat -a USERNAME POST https://api.github.com/repos/astaxie/bat/issues/1/comments body='bat is awesome!'

Upload a file using redirected input:

	$ bat example.org < file.json
	
Download a file and save it via redirected output:

	$ bat example.org/file > file
	
Download a file wget style:

	$ bat --download example.org/file

Set a custom Host header to work around missing DNS records:

	$ bat localhost:8000 Host:example.com
	
What follows is a detailed documentation. It covers the command syntax, advanced usage, and also features additional examples.
	
## HTTP Method
The name of the HTTP method comes right before the URL argument:

	$ bat DELETE example.org/todos/7
	
Which looks similar to the actual Request-Line that is sent:

DELETE /todos/7 HTTP/1.1

When the METHOD argument is omitted from the command, bat defaults to either GET (with no request data) or POST (with request data).

## Request URL
The only information bat needs to perform a request is a URL. The default scheme is, somewhat unsurprisingly, http://, and can be omitted from the argument â€“ http example.org works just fine.

Additionally, curl-like shorthand for localhost is supported. This means that, for example :3000 would expand to http://localhost:3000 If the port is omitted, then port 80 is assumed.

	$ bat :/foo

	GET /foo HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost

	$ bat :3000/bar
	
	GET /bar HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost:3000

	$ bat :

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost

If you find yourself manually constructing URLs with querystring parameters on the terminal, you may appreciate the param==value syntax for appending URL parameters so that you don't have to worry about escaping the & separators. To search for bat on Google Images you could use this command:

	$ bat GET www.google.com search=bat tbm=isch

	GET /?search=bat&tbm=isch HTTP/1.1

## Request Items
There are a few different request item types that provide a convenient mechanism for specifying HTTP headers, simple JSON and form data, files, and URL parameters.

|       Item Type         |	          Description           |
| ------------------------| ------------------------------ | 
|HTTP Headers `Name:Value`|Arbitrary HTTP header, e.g. `X-API-Token:123`.|
|Data Fields `field=value`|Request data fields to be serialized as a JSON object (default), or to be form-encoded (--form, -f).|
|Form File Fields `field@/dir/file`|Only available with `-form`, `-f`. For example `screenshot@~/Pictures/img.png`. The presence of a file field results in a `multipart/form-data` request.|

You can also quote values, e.g. `foo="bar baz"`.
## JSON

## Forms
Submitting forms is very similar to sending JSON requests. Often the only difference is in adding the `-form=true`, `-f` option, which ensures that data fields are serialized as, and Content-Type is set to, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8`.

It is possible to make form data the implicit content type instead of JSON via the config file.

### Regular Forms

	$ bat --form=true POST api.example.org/person/1 name='John Smith' \
    email=john@example.org

	POST /person/1 HTTP/1.1
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8

	name=John+Smith&email=john%40example.org

### File Upload Forms

If one or more file fields is present, the serialization and content type is `multipart/form-data`:

	$ bat -f=true POST example.com/jobs name='John Smith' cv@~/Documents/cv.pdf
	
The request above is the same as if the following HTML form were submitted:

```
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="http://example.com/jobs">
    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <input type="file" name="cv" />
</form>
```

Note that `@` is used to simulate a file upload form field.

## HTTP Headers
To set custom headers you can use the Header:Value notation:

	$ bat example.org  User-Agent:Bacon/1.0  'Cookie:valued-visitor=yes;foo=bar'  \
    X-Foo:Bar  Referer:http://beego.me/

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Accept: */*
	Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
	Cookie: valued-visitor=yes;foo=bar
	Host: example.org
	Referer: http://beego.me/
	User-Agent: Bacon/1.0
	X-Foo: Bar
	
There are a couple of default headers that bat sets:

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Accept: */*
	Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
	User-Agent: bat/<version>
	Host: <taken-from-URL>

Any of the default headers can be overwritten.
